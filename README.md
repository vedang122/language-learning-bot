# Roleplaying Lingo
This is an application which provides an interface for user to chat with a bot for learning any new language.

## Problem I'm solving 
From the past 1 year, I started developing a passion for learning new languages. I've started learning Spanish but even with more than 200 days of streak on Duolingo, I'm unable to clearly understand when I talk to a native Spanish speaker. I'm building an AI voice bot which would talk with me in different languages given a particular scenario/roleplay and level of language expertise I want to practise.

## Current State
