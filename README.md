# LanguageLearningBot
This is an application which provides an interface for user to chat or converse through voice with a bot for learning any new language.

## Problem I'm solving 
From the past 1 year, I started developing a passion for learning new languages. I've started learning Spanish but even with 240 days of streak, I'm not able to clearly understand when I talk to a native Spanish speaker. I'm building an AI voice bot which would talk with me in different languages given a particular scenario(like we are in restaurants etc.) and level of language expertise I want to practise.

## Current State

* User Responses are being updated on the UI

## Next Steps

* Get texts back from the AI model
* Implement a scenario where user and companion is sitting in a restaurant
